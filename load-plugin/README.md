# Load a plugin into a conversation (minimal)

The smallest useful recipe for starting an OpenHands Cloud conversation that has
a **plugin pre-loaded**, using only the V1 App Server REST API. One field —
`plugins` — does the work.

This example is **self-contained**: it ships its own plugin in
[`dad-joke/`](./dad-joke/) and loads it straight from this repo on GitHub. No
external marketplace, no API keys beyond your OpenHands key.

> A plugin is a small git-hosted bundle of slash commands, skills, hooks, and/or
> MCP servers (Claude Code "plugin marketplace" format). `dad-joke` ships one of
> each kind we need: a `/dad-joke:about` slash command that tells a dad joke
> about an animal, and a keyword-triggered skill that asks for your favorite
> animal first.

example [`launch-plugin-badge`](../launch-plugin-badge/), which builds on this
one.

## The one field that matters

```python
requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/app-conversations",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
    json={
        "plugins": [
            {
                "source": "github:jpshackelford/oh-examples",
                "ref": "main",
                "repo_path": "load-plugin/dad-joke",
            }
        ],
        "initial_message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "/dad-joke:about duck"}],
        },
    },
)
```

A plugin spec has three parts:

| Field | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `source` | Where the plugin lives | `github:jpshackelford/oh-examples` |
| `ref` | Git ref/branch/tag | `main` |
| `repo_path` | Plugin sub-directory within the source | `load-plugin/dad-joke` |

> The plugin is fetched from the **`ref`** you name. While iterating on a
> branch, pass `--ref your-branch` so the fetch finds your copy; it resolves to
> `main` once merged.

## Two ways to drive it

The `initial_message` decides what happens once the plugin is loaded:

1. **Run a skill immediately via an entry command.** Send the plugin's slash
   command as the first message. The SDK registers `/dad-joke:about` as a
   keyword trigger, so this tells a joke right away:

   ```bash
   python load_plugin.py --message "/dad-joke:about duck"
   ```

2. **Load the plugin, then prompt normally.** Send a natural-language message;
   the plugin's skills are available for the agent to use when relevant. The
   bundled skill fires on "dad joke", asks for your favorite animal, then
   delivers:

   ```bash
   python load_plugin.py --message "Tell me a dad joke"
   ```

## How the call works

`POST /api/v1/app-conversations` is **asynchronous**. It returns a *start task*,
not a finished conversation. The script polls
`GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks?ids=<task_id>` until the task yields
an `app_conversation_id`, then prints the conversation URL.

(Omitting `sandbox_id` from the request lets the server provision a fresh
sandbox. To attach to a sandbox you prepared yourself, pass its id — see
[`clone-and-attach`](../clone-and-attach/).)

## Run it

```bash
pip install requests
export OH_API_KEY="sk-oh-..."     # Cloud API key

python load_plugin.py             # dad-joke + "/dad-joke:about duck"
```

### Options

| Flag | Env var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--api-key` | `OH_API_KEY` | – (required) |
| `--base-url` | `OH_API_BASE` | `https://app.all-hands.dev` |
| `--source` | `PLUGIN_SOURCE` | `github:jpshackelford/oh-examples` |
| `--ref` | `PLUGIN_REF` | `main` |
| `--repo-path` | `PLUGIN_REPO_PATH` | `load-plugin/dad-joke` |
| `--message` | `INITIAL_MESSAGE` | `/dad-joke:about duck` |
| `--secret` | – | _(none)_ — repeatable `KEY=VALUE`; see below |
| `--poll-timeout` | `POLL_TIMEOUT` | `240` |

## Loading a private plugin

The bundled plugin is public, but `source` also accepts a **full Git URL**, and a
`${VAR}` placeholder in the `source` (or `ref`) is expanded against the
conversation's secrets **just before** the repo is cloned — so you can fetch a
private plugin without hard-coding a token.

> **Version requirement.** Secret expansion in the plugin source landed in
> [software-agent-sdk#3758](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/pull/3758)
> and was released in **SDK [`v1.29.0`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/releases/tag/v1.29.0)**.
> That SDK is referenced by the **OpenHands Enterprise** build on the **Unstable**
> channel (`0.7.64`, tracked by the Replicated `openhands` chart version); `0.7.65`
> is the VM-based Enterprise release being cut to carry it. It had not yet reached
> OpenHands Cloud (app.all-hands.dev) or the Stable channel as of this writing.
>
> On older builds the `${VAR}` reaches `git clone` literally and a private
> source fails at conversation start; a public `source` is unaffected.

There are four ways to supply the credential — all reference it **by name** in
the URL, so the raw token never has to appear in the `source`:

| # | Where the token comes from | How you reference it |
|---|----------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Hard-coded literal token | the raw token in the URL (least desirable) |
| 2 | A user-profile custom secret | `${MY_TOKEN}` |
| 3 | A secret passed to **this** API call | send `secrets: {MY_TOKEN: …}`, reference `${MY_TOKEN}` |
| 4 | An OpenHands-managed provider token | `${GITHUB_TOKEN}`, `${GITLAB_TOKEN}`, `${BITBUCKET_TOKEN}`, `${BITBUCKET_DATA_CENTER_TOKEN}` |

This script demonstrates **scenario 3** with `--secret` (which adds a `secrets`
field to the request):

```bash
python load_plugin.py \
    --source 'https://x-access-token:${GIT_TOKEN}@github.com/me/private-plugins.git' \
    --repo-path plugins/my-plugin \
    --message '/my-plugin:start' \
    --secret GIT_TOKEN="$GIT_TOKEN"
```

Scenario **4** needs no `--secret` at all: if you've connected GitHub/GitLab/
Bitbucket to OpenHands, just reference e.g. `${GITHUB_TOKEN}` and the managed
token is injected for you.

Good to know:

- **Braced `${VAR}` only** — a literal `$` in a token is never mangled.
- **Secrets only, not host env** — host environment variables are never folded
  into the URL (that would be a credential-exfiltration vector).
- **Missing secret → left untouched** — the placeholder stays verbatim, so you
  get a clear clone failure rather than a surprising default.
- **Stays redacted** — the persisted plugin spec keeps the `${VAR}` placeholder,
  not the secret value.
- **HTTPS, not `ssh://`** — the credential travels inside the URL; SSH
  authenticates out-of-band (a key), so there is no placeholder to expand.
