# Clone a repo, run setup, then attach a conversation

This example provisions a sandbox **yourself** — shallow-cloning a git repo and
running its setup script — and only *then* hands it to an OpenHands agent by
**attaching a conversation** to that already-prepared sandbox.

It builds directly on [`start-sandbox`](../start-sandbox/), which shows the bare
sandbox lifecycle. Read that one first if the sandbox/agent-server split is new
to you.

## Why would I do this?

Normally you start a conversation and OpenHands clones your selected repository
for you. Sometimes you want more control *before* the agent gets involved:

- pre-warm an environment so the agent starts instantly on an expensive setup,
- check out a specific commit, tag, or a sub-path of a monorepo,
- clone from a mirror or run custom bootstrapping the default flow doesn't do,
- reuse one prepared sandbox for several scripted conversations.

The trick is a single field: `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` accepts a
`sandbox_id`. Pass the id of a sandbox you already prepared and the new
conversation attaches to it instead of creating a fresh one.

## The flow

```
POST /api/v1/sandboxes                     # 1. start a sandbox (no conversation)
GET  /api/v1/sandboxes?id=<id>             # 2. poll until status == RUNNING
POST {agent}/api/bash/execute_bash_command # 3. git clone --depth 1 <repo>
POST {agent}/api/bash/execute_bash_command # 4. bash .openhands/setup.sh
POST /api/v1/app-conversations             # 5. attach a conversation (sandbox_id=<id>)
GET  /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks # 5b. poll for the app_conversation_id
```

Steps 1–2 use the **Cloud app server** (auth header `X-Session-API-Key: <OH_API_KEY>`).
Steps 3–4 use the sandbox's **agent server** (auth header
`X-Session-API-Key: <session_api_key>`, returned by the create call). Step 5 is
back on the Cloud app server. See [`start-sandbox`](../start-sandbox/) for more
on the two-server split.

### Where does `setup.sh` live?

In the repository, at `.openhands/setup.sh`. That is the exact location
OpenHands itself runs every time it starts working with a repo — see
[Repository Customization](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/customization/repository).
This example runs that same file so the sandbox you hand off is set up the way
the agent would expect. If a repo has no `.openhands/setup.sh`, the step is
skipped with a note. (This repo ships a tiny one so the default run does
something visible.)

### Attaching is asynchronous

`POST /api/v1/app-conversations` returns a **start task**, not the conversation
itself. Poll `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks?ids=<task_id>` until it
reports an `app_conversation_id`, then open
`https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/<app_conversation_id>`.

## Run it

```bash
export OH_API_KEY=...        # your https://app.all-hands.dev API key
pip install requests

# Zero-config: clones this repo (it has a .openhands/setup.sh) and attaches
# a conversation that summarizes it.
python attach_conversation.py
```

Sample output:

```
sandbox: 1ho9eZpt4m27CC23XPdGcN
  sandbox status: RUNNING
agent: https://ahhygodzefollslv.prod-runtime.all-hands.dev

=== shallow clone https://github.com/jpshackelford/oh-examples -> /workspace/oh-examples ===
$ git clone  (exit=0)

=== run .openhands/setup.sh ===
$ setup script  (exit=0)
[oh-examples setup.sh] running in /workspace/oh-examples
[oh-examples setup.sh] python: Python 3.13.13
[oh-examples setup.sh] done

=== attach conversation ===
  start-task status: STARTING_CONVERSATION
  start-task status: READY

Conversation attached to your prepared sandbox:
  https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/f041a2e252cf45b39a46a3189b2efce7
```

Open that URL and you'll find the agent already in a workspace where your repo
is cloned and set up.

## Point it at your own repo

Every input is a flag with an environment-variable fallback, so the script is
safe to drop into your own automation unchanged:

| Flag | Env var | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| `--api-key` | `OH_API_KEY` | — (required) | Cloud API key |
| `--base-url` | `OH_API_BASE` | `https://app.all-hands.dev` | Cloud app server |
| `--repo` | `REPO_URL` | this repo | Git URL to shallow-clone |
| `--branch` | `REPO_BRANCH` | repo default | Branch to check out |
| `--depth` | `CLONE_DEPTH` | `1` | `git clone --depth` |
| `--workdir` | `WORKDIR` | `/workspace` | Where the repo is cloned |
| `--setup-script` | `SETUP_SCRIPT` | `.openhands/setup.sh` | Script to run after clone |
| `--message` | `INITIAL_MESSAGE` | a summarize prompt | First message to the agent |
| `--sandbox-id` | `SANDBOX_ID` | none | Reuse a RUNNING sandbox instead of creating one |
| `--sandbox-spec-id` | `SANDBOX_SPEC_ID` | account default | Runtime image to start |
| `--poll-timeout` | `POLL_TIMEOUT` | `240` | Seconds to wait for readiness |

```bash
python attach_conversation.py \
    --repo https://github.com/your-org/your-repo \
    --branch main \
    --message "Run the test suite and fix any failures."
```

## Cleanup

The sandbox is intentionally left running because a live conversation is now
attached to it — deleting the sandbox ends that conversation. Delete it from the
conversation UI, or via the API (the id goes in **both** the path and a required
`sandbox_id` query parameter):

```bash
SID=<sandbox_id>
curl -X DELETE "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/v1/sandboxes/${SID}?sandbox_id=${SID}" \
     -H "X-Session-API-Key: $OH_API_KEY"
```
