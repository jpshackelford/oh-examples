# GPG Commit Signing on Every Conversation (SessionStart hook)

Configure **GPG commit signing at the start of every conversation** — not just
when a repository is selected — using a `SessionStart` hook bundled in a plugin.

The [`gpg-signer/`](./gpg-signer/) plugin imports a private key from a
[custom secret](#the-secret) and configures git to sign commits and tags
**globally**, so signing applies to any repo the agent clones during the
session.

## The problem this solves

Teams often configure signing today in `.openhands/setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
echo "$gpg_key" | gpg --import
KEY_ID=$(echo "$gpg_key" | gpg --show-keys --with-colons | awk -F: '/^fpr/{print $10; exit}')
git config user.signingkey "$KEY_ID"
git config commit.gpgsign true
git config user.name "$git_user_name"
git config user.email "$git_user_email"
```

But **`setup.sh` only runs when the conversation is started with a repository
selected.** Start a conversation with no repo (or have the agent clone a repo
later) and signing is silently missing.

A **`SessionStart` hook runs at the beginning of *every* conversation**,
regardless of whether a repo was picked — exactly when you want signing set up.
That is the whole idea behind this example.

## Why the hook can read the same secret as `setup.sh`

On the agent-server, hook scripts and `setup.sh` execute against the **same
process environment**. A custom secret named `gpg_key` that `setup.sh` can read
as `$gpg_key` is visible to the `SessionStart` hook the same way — so the logic
you already run in `setup.sh` moves into the hook almost verbatim.

Two differences from the raw `setup.sh` version, both deliberate:

- **`git config --global`** instead of a bare `git config`. There is no
  repository yet when `SessionStart` fires, and a global config applies to every
  repo cloned afterwards.
- **Never fails the session.** `SessionStart` hooks cannot block, so on any
  problem (missing secret, bad key) the hook logs the reason to
  `/tmp/openhands_gpg_setup.log` and exits `0`.

## The secret

Add these under **Settings → Secrets** in OpenHands (or pass them per
conversation via the API):

| Secret name | Contents | Required |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| `gpg_key` | ASCII-armored **private** key — `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys you@example.com` | Yes |
| `git_user_name` | Git author name | Optional |
| `git_user_email` | Git author email (should match a key UID) | Optional |

If `gpg_key` is absent the hook does nothing (and says so in the log), so it is
safe to load the plugin for everyone and let it activate only where a key is
configured.

> Secret names are configurable through the `GPG_KEY_SECRET_NAME`,
> `GIT_USER_NAME_SECRET_NAME`, and `GIT_USER_EMAIL_SECRET_NAME` environment
> variables if your org uses different names.

## What's in the box

```
gpg-signer/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json                      # Plugin metadata
├── hooks/
│   ├── hooks.json                       # SessionStart hook (inline script)
│   └── scripts/
│       └── configure_gpg_signing.sh     # Readable reference copy of the inline script
└── skills/
    └── gpg-signer/
        └── SKILL.md                     # Docs the agent reads (auto-loaded)
```

## The hook

The logic lives in [`hooks/hooks.json`](./gpg-signer/hooks/hooks.json) under the
`SessionStart` event:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "…import key + git config --global…", "timeout": 30 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**How it works:**

1. **`SessionStart`** — runs once, when the conversation begins (no repo needed).
2. Reads the armored key from `$gpg_key`, imports it with `gpg --batch --import`.
3. Extracts the primary key fingerprint (`gpg --show-keys --with-colons`).
4. Sets `user.signingkey`, `commit.gpgsign true`, `tag.gpgsign true`, and
   `gpg.program` **globally**, plus the optional identity secrets.
5. Exits `0` always; all human-readable output goes to
   `/tmp/openhands_gpg_setup.log` (on a successful hook, stdout is parsed as
   JSON, so it is kept clean).

> **Why the script is inlined (and mirrored in `hooks/scripts/`).** When this
> runs as a **plugin**, hooks execute with the working directory set to the
> agent's workspace (not the plugin directory), and there is no plugin-root path
> variable — so `command` **cannot** point at a bundled
> `hooks/scripts/*.sh`. The runnable copy is therefore inlined in `hooks.json`;
> [`hooks/scripts/configure_gpg_signing.sh`](./gpg-signer/hooks/scripts/configure_gpg_signing.sh)
> is a readable reference that mirrors it. Edit the reference first, then mirror
> it into `hooks.json`. (Same pattern as the
> [`workspace-isolation`](../workspace-isolation/) example.)

## Try it

### Option 1: Load via API

Use the companion [`load-plugin`](../load-plugin/) example. Because the plugin
needs your key, pass it as a per-conversation secret:

```bash
cd ../load-plugin
python load_plugin.py \
  --repo-path gpg-commit-signing/gpg-signer \
  --secret gpg_key="$(gpg --armor --export-secret-keys you@example.com)" \
  --secret git_user_name="Your Name" \
  --secret git_user_email="you@example.com" \
  --message "Show me the output of: git config --global --get commit.gpgsign and git config --global --get user.signingkey"

# Expected: commit.gpgsign=true and user.signingkey=<fingerprint>
```

> If you have already stored `gpg_key` as a user-level secret, the `--secret`
> flags are unnecessary — the hook will pick it up automatically.

### Option 2: Launch via badge

Store `gpg_key` as a user secret first (the badge can't carry your private key),
then click:

> **Note:** Replace `ref: main` with your branch name if testing before merge.

## Verifying a signed commit

Once the hook has run, any commit is signed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World && cd Hello-World
echo "test" >> README && git commit -am "signed test"
git log --show-signature -1     # -> "Good signature from ..."
```

## Hook types

`SessionStart` is one of several lifecycle events you can hook. See the other
examples for blocking hooks:

| Hook | When It Runs | Can Block? | Example |
|------|--------------|------------|---------|
| PreToolUse | Before tool execution | ✅ Yes (exit 2) | [`command-blacklist`](../command-blacklist/), [`command-whitelist`](../command-whitelist/), [`workspace-isolation`](../workspace-isolation/) |
| PostToolUse | After tool execution | ❌ No | Logging, metrics |
| UserPromptSubmit | Before processing user message | ✅ Yes | Content filtering |
| Stop | When agent tries to finish | ✅ Yes | Require artifacts |
| **SessionStart** | **When conversation starts** | ❌ No | **Environment setup (this example)** |
| SessionEnd | When conversation ends | ❌ No | Cleanup |
