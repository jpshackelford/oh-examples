# Custom System Prompt via App Conversation API

Override the OpenHands system prompt for one conversation with your own text,
using the Cloud **App Conversation API**.

`POST /api/v1/app-conversations` accepts a `system_prompt` field. When set,
it **replaces** the default static system prompt for that conversation. The
per-conversation dynamic context — repo context, loaded skills, custom
secrets, current datetime — is still appended automatically, so your custom
prompt composes with whatever runtime context the sandbox provides.

Feature shipped in OpenHands Enterprise **1.62.0**
([enterprise#335](https://github.com/OpenHands/enterprise/pull/335)) and is
also live on OpenHands Cloud.

## When to use this

- Your agent has a specialised role (research assistant, code reviewer,
  documentation writer) and the default coding-agent framing gets in the way.
- You're building a domain-specific product on top of OpenHands and want to
  own the prompt without asking the agent to *ignore* the default one.
- You need to enforce specific behaviour or persona for a single
  conversation without changing user- or org-level settings.

For long-lived overrides, put the text in an **agent profile** instead;
`system_prompt` is a per-conversation override.

## What gets replaced, and what doesn't

`SystemPromptEvent` is the first event in every conversation and carries
two structured fields:

| Field | Contains | Overridden by `system_prompt`? |
|---|---|---|
| `system_prompt` | The static system prompt (a `{cache_prompt, type, text}` object) | **Yes** — its `.text` becomes your custom prompt verbatim |
| `dynamic_context` | Runtime context: repo context, `<SKILLS>`, `<CUSTOM_SECRETS>`, `<CURRENT_DATETIME>`, host info | No — still appended by the server |

`system_message_suffix` is a *separate* field on the same request and is
appended to the dynamic context; you can set both.

## Anatomy of the default system prompt

Before you replace the default prompt wholesale, it's worth knowing what
you're displacing. The SDK composes the prompt from a small set of named,
guarded sections. The references below are pinned to
[`software-agent-sdk@v1.50.1`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/tree/v1.50.1)
so the line numbers and content stay stable; bump the tag when auditing a
newer release.

### Two blocks on one system message

The default agent ships the prompt as a `SystemPromptEvent` with two
content blocks on a single `role: system` message
([`event/llm_convertible/system.py`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/v1.50.1/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/event/llm_convertible/system.py)):

| Block | Field on the event | What it carries | Cacheable |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (static) | `system_prompt.text` | Identity, role, work habits, security policy, model-specific rules | **Yes** — marked `cache_prompt=True` |
| 2 (dynamic) | `dynamic_context.text` | Current datetime, repo context, loaded `<SKILLS>`, custom `<CUSTOM_SECRETS>`, your `system_message_suffix` | **No** — left unmarked so the static prefix stays shared across conversations |

The caching split is wired in
[`llm/llm.py::_apply_prompt_caching`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/v1.50.1/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/llm/llm.py)
— for Anthropic-style prefix caching, only index 0 gets the cache marker.
Every conversation your account starts can hit the same cached static
block, which is the whole reason the two-block shape exists.

### What goes into each block

Static-tier sections live in
[`context/prompts/sections/static.py`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/v1.50.1/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/context/prompts/sections/static.py);
dynamic-tier sections in
[`context/prompts/sections/dynamic.py`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/v1.50.1/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/context/prompts/sections/dynamic.py).
The default composition order is pinned in
[`context/prompts/presets.py`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/v1.50.1/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/context/prompts/presets.py):

**Static block, in order** — `<SOUL>` and `<ROLE>` (identity), `<MEMORY>`
(AGENTS.md or persistent-memory guidance), `<EFFICIENCY>`,
`<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>`, `<CODE_QUALITY>`, `<VERSION_CONTROL>`,
`<PULL_REQUESTS>`, `<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>`, `<SELF_DOCUMENTATION>`
(work habits), `<SECURITY>` and `<SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>` (safety
policy), `<BROWSER_TOOLS>` (only if `enable_browser`),
`<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>`, `<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>`, `<TROUBLESHOOTING>`,
`<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>`, and `<IMPORTANT>` (per-model-family tweaks for
Claude, Gemini, GPT-5).

**Dynamic block, in order** — `<REPO_CONTEXT>`, `<MEMORY_CONTEXT>`,
`<SKILLS>`, your `system_message_suffix` (raw, no wrapper),
`<CUSTOM_SECRETS>`, and `<CURRENT_DATETIME>` **last** on purpose: it's
the only per-conversation volatile value, so putting it at the tail keeps
the stable dynamic content a cache-friendly prefix even on providers that
cache the dynamic block too.

Setting `system_prompt` on `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` **replaces the
entire static block above** — all 17-ish sections, verbatim text and all —
with your custom text. The dynamic block is unaffected.

### Writing a custom `system_prompt` without breaking caching

The static block's whole value is that it's the same bytes every time your
account hits the LLM. Anthropic's prefix cache keys on the exact byte
prefix: a one-character change splits one cached prefix into two, each
with its own cold-start cost on the next miss. OpenAI's and Gemini's
caches have the same shape of pitfall. So when you write your own
`system_prompt`:

- **Don't interpolate per-conversation volatile values** into the text.
  No `datetime.now()`, no request id, no conversation id, no user email,
  no repo URL, no sandbox id, no working directory. Any of these in the
  static block means every conversation gets its own cache entry —
  effectively no caching at all.
- **Don't interpolate per-user profile fields** either (API key, display
  name, org name). Even if the value changes rarely, it still shards the
  cache per-user, and anything secret-shaped doesn't belong in a cached
  blob.
- **If you need date-aware behaviour, read the dynamic block.** The server
  always appends `<CURRENT_DATETIME>` to `dynamic_context` — reference it
  from the static text (e.g. "see `<CURRENT_DATETIME>` for today's date")
  instead of baking a timestamp in.
- **Keep the exact same bytes across runs that are logically "the same
  agent".** If you tweak wording, do it on a deploy boundary, not inside
  the request path.
- **Front-load the parts you're least likely to edit.** On a tail-only
  edit, the longest unchanged prefix still hits the cache; on a prefix
  edit, nothing does.
- **If you need per-conversation flavour, use `system_message_suffix`**
  (goes into the uncached dynamic block) rather than templating it into
  `system_prompt`.

A sanity check: hash the string you're about to send
(`hashlib.sha256(system_prompt.encode()).hexdigest()[:12]`) and log it. If
that hash changes between two conversations that should be equivalent, you
have a cache leak.

### `system_prompt` vs. skills vs. `system_message_suffix` — when to use which

All three let you shape the agent's instructions, but they pay very
different context-window and caching costs:

| Mechanism | Where it lands | Cost | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system_prompt` | Cached static block | Paid once per unique prompt, then free (within the cache window) | Identity, tone, hard rules, response format — things the agent should see on **every** turn of **every** conversation |
| **Skills** (`disabled_skills` on the start request, or your own via the plugin / sandbox-upload paths) | Dynamic `<SKILLS>` block, with per-skill bodies loaded only on trigger | Catalog line costs tokens every turn; the full skill body only costs tokens on turns it fires | Specialised procedures, long reference material, service-specific recipes — things that matter **sometimes** |
| `system_message_suffix` | Dynamic block (uncached), appended after `<CUSTOM_SECRETS>` | Paid every turn, every conversation it's set on | Short per-conversation nudges that compose with the default without rewriting the full static text |

Rule of thumb — **if the instruction applies to every turn of every
conversation this agent runs, it belongs in `system_prompt`. If it
applies sometimes, make it a skill. If it's a one-conversation tweak,
use `system_message_suffix`.**

Resist the urge to pack long domain procedures into `system_prompt` just
because it feels tidier. Every token in the static block is a token the
LLM reads before responding to anything — a skill that fires on 1-in-20
turns pays its full-body cost ~5% as often as the static block does.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install requests
export OH_API_KEY="your-api-key"   # Cloud: Profile → API Keys.
                                   # OHE: Settings → API Keys on your instance.
```

You do **not** need to set LLM credentials — the App Server uses whatever
LLM your account is configured with.

## Run

```bash
python custom_system_prompt.py

# or against an OpenHands Enterprise instance:
python custom_system_prompt.py --base-url https://your-ohe.example.com

# supply your own prompt / message:
python custom_system_prompt.py \
    --prompt "You are Sir Reginald, a pirate. Every reply starts with 'Arrr!'" \
    --message "Say hello."

# keep resources for inspection (no cleanup at the end):
python custom_system_prompt.py --keep
```

The script starts a conversation with `system_prompt` set, fetches the first
`SystemPromptEvent`, asserts the custom text is there, and cleans up.
Exit status is non-zero if verification fails.

## How it works

### 1. Start the conversation

`POST /api/v1/app-conversations` is asynchronous: it returns a
[`AppConversationStartTask`](https://docs.all-hands.dev/) whose `id` is the
**task id**, not the conversation id. Omit `sandbox_id` and the App Server
provisions a fresh sandbox for you.

```python
payload = {
    "system_prompt": "You are a research assistant...",
    "initial_message": {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Say hello."}],
    },
    "title": "custom-system-prompt demo",
}
task = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/app-conversations",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
    json=payload,
).json()
task_id = task["id"]
```

### 2. Wait for `app_conversation_id`

Poll `/api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks?ids=<task_id>` until the task
reaches `READY` and hands back `app_conversation_id` (and, if the server
provisioned one, `sandbox_id`). The endpoint is a "search by ids"
lookup — `ids` is a required, repeatable query parameter and the
response is a JSON array of the matching tasks.

```python
while not conv_id:
    time.sleep(3)
    item = requests.get(
        f"{base_url}/api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks",
        headers=headers,
        params={"ids": task_id},
    ).json()[0]
    if item["status"] == "ERROR":
        raise RuntimeError(item.get("detail"))
    conv_id = item.get("app_conversation_id")
    sandbox_id = item.get("sandbox_id") or sandbox_id
```

### 3. Verify from the `SystemPromptEvent`

The Cloud events endpoint mirrors the agent-server view, so you can read
the event without needing the sandbox's `session_api_key`.

```python
event = requests.get(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/conversation/{conv_id}/events/search",
    headers=headers,
    params={"kind__eq": "SystemPromptEvent", "limit": 1},
).json()["items"][0]

assert custom_prompt in event["system_prompt"]["text"]
```

Note the shape: `event["system_prompt"]` is a `{cache_prompt, type, text}`
object — the actual prompt string is at `.text`.

### 4. Cleanup

`DELETE /api/v1/app-conversations/{id}` frees the conversation. Delete the
sandbox separately when you're done with it. The sandbox delete endpoint
is `DELETE /api/v1/sandboxes/{id}` and additionally requires `sandbox_id`
as a query parameter — pass the same id in both places, or the server
returns HTTP 422.

```python
requests.delete(f"{base_url}/api/v1/app-conversations/{conv_id}", headers=headers)
requests.delete(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}",
    headers=headers,
    params={"sandbox_id": sandbox_id},
)
```

## Prompt gallery

Swap `--prompt` (or `SYSTEM_PROMPT`) for any of these to try them out.

### Research assistant

```
You are a research assistant. Answer questions concisely and accurately.
When writing code, focus on clarity and simplicity. Always cite your sources
when making factual claims.
```

### Code reviewer

```
You are a code reviewer. Analyze code for correctness, security, and
maintainability. Provide specific, actionable feedback. Focus on material
issues, not style preferences.
```

### Documentation writer

```
You are a technical documentation writer. Write clear, accurate, and
comprehensive documentation. Use examples to illustrate concepts.
Structure content with clear headings and logical flow.
```

### Data analyst

```
You are a data analyst. Analyze data to extract insights and patterns.
Use appropriate statistical methods and visualizations. Explain your
findings clearly with supporting evidence.
```

## Composition with `system_message_suffix`

`system_message_suffix` is a separate field appended to the dynamic
context. You can use both together:

```python
payload = {
    "system_prompt": "You are a research assistant...",
    "system_message_suffix": "Focus on academic papers published after 2020.",
    ...
}
```

The resulting prompt structure is:

```
[system_prompt.text          — your custom static prompt]

[dynamic_context.text        — repo context, skills, secrets, datetime]
[system_message_suffix       — appended to the dynamic context]
```

## Planning agent (`agent_type=plan`)

When `agent_type=plan` is set alongside `system_prompt`, the custom prompt
still replaces the built-in planning static prompt, but the planning tools
and workflow instructions are kept — the agent keeps its ability to create
and update plans, with your text as the foundation.

## ACP agents

For ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) agents, which delegate to external
CLIs (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.), `system_prompt` is **ignored** with a
server-side warning (`app_conversation_start:system_prompt_ignored_for_acp_agent`).
ACP agents own their own system prompt and cannot be overridden via the REST
API.

## Endpoints used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/app-conversations` | POST | Start the conversation (returns a start task) |
| `/api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks` | GET | Poll the start task for `app_conversation_id` |
| `/api/v1/conversation/{id}/events/search` | GET | Read `SystemPromptEvent` to verify |
| `/api/v1/app-conversations/{id}` | DELETE | Delete the conversation |
| `/api/v1/sandboxes/{id}?sandbox_id={id}` | DELETE | Delete the sandbox |

All calls use `Authorization: Bearer <OH_API_KEY>`.
