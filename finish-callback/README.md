# Finish Callback with a Stop Hook

A self-contained example showing how to **notify an external URL the moment a
conversation finishes**, using a **Stop hook** — instead of finding out only by
polling. When the agent reaches a terminal state, the hook `POST`s to a URL you
control, optionally attaching a payload file's contents.

This is the "push instead of poll" pattern: keep your existing polling loop as a
safety net, but let the callback wake you up immediately in the common case.

> **About the badge:** clicking it loads the plugin into a fresh conversation,
> but the `/launch` route only carries `plugins` + `message` — **not secrets**.
> Without `OH_CALLBACK_URL` the hook is a deliberate no-op, so the badge is a
> "see the plugin load" demo. To actually receive a callback you must supply the
> secrets, which means the API path below (`load_finish_callback.py`) or your own
> call to `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` with a `secrets` field.

> **No customer information lives in this plugin.** The callback URL, an optional
> shared-secret token, and an optional payload file path all come from
> **conversation secrets** at start time. The repo ships only a local test
> receiver so you can prove the end-to-end flow against your own machine.

## How It Works

```
Agent finishes its work → conversation reaches FINISHED
  ↓
Stop hook fires (before the stop is finalized)
  ├─ reads OH_CALLBACK_URL / OH_CALLBACK_TOKEN / OH_CALLBACK_PAYLOAD from env
  ├─ builds the body: your payload file, or a small default JSON envelope
  └─ POSTs to your URL (async, best-effort, short timeout)
  ↓
Agent stops normally (the hook always exits 0 — it never blocks)
  ↓
Your receiver gets the POST and reacts immediately
```

## Configuration

Everything is supplied as **conversation secrets** — nothing is hard-coded:

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `OH_CALLBACK_URL` | Yes | Where to `POST`. If unset, the hook is a harmless no-op. |
| `OH_CALLBACK_TOKEN` | No | Sent as the `X-Callback-Token` header so your receiver can verify the caller. |
| `OH_CALLBACK_PAYLOAD` | No | Path (inside the sandbox) to a JSON file whose raw contents become the POST body. Omit it to send the default envelope. |

Default body when no payload file is given:

```json
{"status": "finished", "session_id": "<session>", "finished_at": "<UTC ISO-8601>"}
```

## Try It End-to-End

You need two things reachable from the sandbox: a **running receiver** and a
**public URL** that forwards to it. The receiver is stdlib-only; the loader
needs `requests`:

```bash
pip install requests
```

You'll also need a Cloud API key (`export OH_API_KEY="sk-oh-..."`).

### 1. Start the receiver

```bash
cd finish-callback
python callback_receiver.py --port 8000
# add --token s3cr3t to require the X-Callback-Token header
```

It prints every POST it receives (pretty-printed JSON) and replies `204`.

### 2. Expose it to the internet

The sandbox runs in the cloud, so it needs a public URL to reach your laptop.
Use any tunnel, e.g.:

```bash
# examples — pick whichever you have
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
ngrok http 8000
```

Note the public `https://…` URL it gives you. That's your `OH_CALLBACK_URL`.

### 3. Start a conversation with the plugin loaded

Use the bundled turnkey helper. It loads the plugin **and** passes the callback
settings as conversation secrets, so the Stop hook picks them up as environment
variables:

```bash
cd finish-callback
export OH_API_KEY="sk-oh-..."          # Cloud API key
python load_finish_callback.py \
  --callback-url "https://your-tunnel.example/oh_finish" \
  --callback-token "s3cr3t"

# Expected: when the agent finishes, your receiver prints a POST like:
#   {"status": "finished", "session_id": "...", "finished_at": "..."}
```

To send your own body instead of the default envelope, add
`--callback-payload "/path/in/sandbox/body.json"` (the path is resolved inside
the sandbox, not on your laptop).

**Prefer the generic loader?** [`load-plugin`](../load-plugin/) does the same
thing with `--secret` flags:

```bash
cd ../load-plugin
python load_plugin.py \
  --repo-path finish-callback/oh-finish-callback \
  --message "Say hello and then finish." \
  --secret OH_CALLBACK_URL="https://your-tunnel.example/oh_finish" \
  --secret OH_CALLBACK_TOKEN="s3cr3t"
```

> **Heads-up:** the callback fires on **every** transition to `FINISHED` — so it
> also covers follow-up messages you send later, not just the first run.

## Verify the Hook Locally (no sandbox needed)

You can exercise the exact hook script against a local receiver in one shell:

```bash
cd finish-callback
python callback_receiver.py --port 8000 &          # start receiver

echo '{"event_type":"Stop"}' \
  | OPENHANDS_SESSION_ID="local-test" \
    OH_CALLBACK_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/oh_finish" \
    sh oh-finish-callback/hooks/on_stop.sh          # run the hook

# The receiver prints the POST it just got.
```

## The Hook

The magic is in [`hooks/hooks.json`](./oh-finish-callback/hooks/hooks.json):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cat >/dev/null; ... curl -s -m 10 -X POST \"$OH_CALLBACK_URL\" ...; exit 0",
            "timeout": 15,
            "async": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**How it works:**

1. **`Stop`** — runs when the agent tries to finish (the terminal-state moment).
2. **`matcher: "*"`** — Stop hooks aren't tool-specific, so match everything.
3. **`type: "command"`** — the `command` is a POSIX-sh script run via `/bin/sh -c`.
4. **`async: true`** — fire-and-forget, so the callback never delays finishing.
5. **Exit codes:** `0` = allow the agent to finish (this hook always does);
   `2` would *block* finishing (we deliberately never do that).

The script reads its config from the environment, builds the body, and `curl`s
your URL with a short timeout, swallowing errors.

> **Why inline (not a reference to the bundled `on_stop.sh`)?** When hooks run as
> a **plugin**, they execute with the working directory set to the agent's
> workspace (not the plugin directory), and there is no plugin-root path
> variable — so a relative path like `hooks/on_stop.sh` won't resolve.
> [`on_stop.sh`](./oh-finish-callback/hooks/on_stop.sh) is kept as the readable,
> locally-testable **source of truth**; the identical script is embedded inline
> in `hooks.json`, which is the copy that actually runs. If you edit the script,
> re-embed it:
>
> ```bash
> python - <<'PY'
> import json
> s = open("oh-finish-callback/hooks/on_stop.sh").read()
> cfg = {"hooks": {"Stop": [{"matcher": "*", "hooks": [
>     {"type": "command", "command": s, "timeout": 15, "async": True}]}]}}
> json.dump(cfg, open("oh-finish-callback/hooks/hooks.json", "w"), indent=2)
> open("oh-finish-callback/hooks/hooks.json", "a").write("\n")
> PY
> ```

## Reliability: callback + polling

The callback is a **latency optimization, not a delivery guarantee**. It won't
fire if:

- the sandbox dies or the run errors out before reaching `FINISHED`,
- the receiver is down or the URL is unreachable, or
- the POST times out.

So keep your polling loop as the **safety net** and treat the callback as the
fast path. That's exactly the hybrid the pattern is designed for: react
immediately when the callback arrives, fall back to polling when it doesn't.

## Hook Types

Hooks can intercept different lifecycle events:

| Hook | When It Runs | Can Block? | Use Case |
|------|--------------|------------|----------|
| PreToolUse | Before tool execution | ✅ Yes (exit 2) | Command validation |
| PostToolUse | After tool execution | ❌ No | Logging, metrics |
| UserPromptSubmit | Before processing user message | ✅ Yes | Content filtering |
| **Stop** | **When the agent tries to finish** | ✅ Yes | **Finish notification (this example)** |
| SessionStart | When a conversation starts | ❌ No | Setup, logging |
| SessionEnd | When a conversation ends | ❌ No | Cleanup |
