# React to conversation state changes over a WebSocket

Two short scripts that react to OpenHands conversation state changes **as they
happen**, instead of polling a REST endpoint in a loop. Each starts a sandbox,
gets a conversation running on the sandbox's agent-server, then subscribes to
that conversation's event stream over a WebSocket and prints every
`execution_status` transition (`running` → `finished`/`error`) the moment the
agent-server emits it.

This is the event-driven counterpart to the polling loops in
[`start-sandbox`](../start-sandbox/) and [`clone-and-attach`](../clone-and-attach/),
which repeatedly `GET` the status until it changes. Here nothing polls the
*conversation's execution state* — the script blocks on the socket and is woken
by the server.

## Two ways to get the conversation running

Both scripts watch state identically over the same WebSocket. They differ only
in **how the conversation is created**, and that choice comes with a genuine
trade-off:

| Script | Creates the conversation via | LLM credentials | Start-task poll |
|--------|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [`watch_attach.py`](./watch_attach.py) | **Cloud** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (attach to sandbox) | **Not needed** — the Cloud layer injects your account's LLM | **Required** — the call is async and returns a *start task*, so you poll `start-tasks` for the conversation id |
| [`watch_direct.py`](./watch_direct.py) | **Agent-server** `POST /api/conversations` | **Required** — a direct conversation inherits no Cloud LLM creds, so you pass `--llm-model` / `--llm-api-key` | **Not needed** — the id is returned synchronously |

In one sentence: **if you want to avoid passing an LLM key, you accept a brief
start-task poll; if you want to avoid the poll, you accept passing an LLM key.**
Neither poll is on the *conversation's execution state* — that is always
event-driven. `watch_attach.py`'s poll is provisioning latency (waiting for the
sandbox to prepare skills/repo and start the conversation); once it hands back an
id, the socket takes over.

> Both approaches attach to a sandbox first, exactly like
> [`clone-and-attach`](../clone-and-attach/) — the WebSocket lives on the
> sandbox's agent-server regardless of which endpoint created the conversation.

## APIs used

### 1. Cloud App Server — manages the sandbox lifecycle

- Base URL: `https://app.all-hands.dev`
- Auth header: `X-Session-API-Key: <OH_API_KEY>`
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/sandboxes` — start a sandbox (optional `?sandbox_spec_id=…`)
  - `GET  /api/v1/sandboxes?id=<id>` — batch-get sandboxes by id
  - `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` — **attach** a conversation to a sandbox
    (`watch_attach.py` only); returns a start task
  - `GET  /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks?ids=<id>` — poll for the
    `app_conversation_id` (`watch_attach.py` only)
  - `DELETE /api/v1/sandboxes/{id}?sandbox_id=<id>` — clean up

### 2. Agent Server — runs inside the sandbox

- Base URL: the entry in `sandbox.exposed_urls` with `name == "AGENT_SERVER"`.
- Auth header: `X-Session-API-Key: <session_api_key>` returned by the
  sandbox-create call (different from your Cloud API key).
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/conversations` — create a conversation directly
    (`watch_direct.py` only). Body requires a `workspace` and an `agent` (with
    an `llm`); an `initial_message` makes it start running immediately.
  - `GET  /sockets/events/{conversation_id}` — **WebSocket** event stream. This
    is the shared star of both scripts. Authenticate by sending
    `{"type": "auth", "session_api_key": "…"}` as the first frame. Add
    `?resend_mode=all` to replay events already produced since the conversation
    started (this closes the create→connect race without polling).

> Full Agent Server schema is at `<agent_server_url>/openapi.json` once the
> sandbox is `RUNNING`.

## The flow

```
                          ┌─ watch_attach.py ─────────────────────────────────┐
POST /api/v1/sandboxes    │ POST /api/v1/app-conversations  (attach)          │
GET  …/sandboxes?id=<id>  │ GET  …/start-tasks?ids=<id>     (poll for id)     │
  (until RUNNING)         └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ┌─ watch_direct.py ─────────────────────────────────┐
                          │ POST {agent}/api/conversations  (id returned now) │
                          └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
WS   {agent}/sockets/events/<id>?resend_mode=all   # react to states (shared)
DELETE /api/v1/sandboxes/<id>?sandbox_id=<id>      # clean up
```

### Why the WebSocket instead of polling?

The agent-server emits a `ConversationStateUpdateEvent` with
`key == "execution_status"` on every transition. Subscribing means you learn
about `finished` (or `error`/`stuck`) the instant it happens, with no request
spam and no latency floor set by your poll interval. The socket also carries the
other events (`MessageEvent`, `ActionEvent`, `StreamingDeltaEvent`, …) if you
want to follow the agent's work in real time.

## What they print

`watch_attach.py` (note the short start-task poll, then the socket):

```
sandbox: 6MTcHjsITPtO09W0yYLHSd
  sandbox status: RUNNING
agent: https://zztaextwktekrdgh.prod-runtime.all-hands.dev

=== attaching conversation (start-task poll) ===
  start-task status: SETTING_UP_SKILLS
  start-task status: STARTING_CONVERSATION
  start-task status: READY
conversation: b04bc6236d8745d7a83b2e2d3714f1a9

=== watching conversation state (WebSocket) ===
  .. SystemPromptEvent
  .. MessageEvent
  >> execution_status: running
  .. StreamingDeltaEvent
  .. MessageEvent
  >> execution_status: finished
=== done ===

Cleaning up sandbox…
```

`watch_direct.py` (no start-task poll; id is immediate):

```
sandbox: 1ChU3JfCyeKY2hprWBIQ8n
  sandbox status: RUNNING
agent: https://aurgryilvhwboigr.prod-runtime.all-hands.dev
conversation: 1239717a-0396-435b-bfb8-f0b857891fd7

=== watching conversation state (WebSocket) ===
  .. SystemPromptEvent
  .. MessageEvent
  >> execution_status: running
  .. MessageEvent
  >> execution_status: finished
=== done ===

Cleaning up sandbox…
```

## Run it

```bash
export OH_API_KEY=...        # your https://app.all-hands.dev API key
pip install requests websockets
```

**No LLM key (Cloud attach):**

```bash
python watch_attach.py --message "List the files in /workspace/project"
```

**No start-task poll (agent-server direct):** a conversation created directly on
the agent-server does not inherit Cloud LLM credentials, so pass your own:

```bash
export LLM_API_KEY=...
python watch_direct.py --llm-model "gpt-4o-mini" --message "Say hello, then stop."
```

The default `gpt-4o-mini` expects a real OpenAI key. If you route through a proxy
(e.g. a LiteLLM endpoint), also pass `--llm-base-url` and a model name your proxy
recognizes:

```bash
export LLM_API_KEY=...   # your proxy key
python watch_direct.py \
  --llm-model "litellm_proxy/anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5" \
  --llm-base-url "https://your-proxy.example.com" \
  --message "Say hello, then stop."
```

### Flags

Shared by both scripts:

| Flag | Env var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--api-key` | `OH_API_KEY` | — (required) |
| `--base-url` | `OH_API_BASE` | `https://app.all-hands.dev` |
| `--sandbox-spec-id` | `SANDBOX_SPEC_ID` | none (account default image) |
| `--message` | — | `Say hello, then stop.` |
| `--poll-timeout` | `POLL_TIMEOUT` | `180` (seconds) |
| `--keep` | — | off (deletes the sandbox at the end) |

`watch_direct.py` also takes:

| Flag | Env var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--llm-model` | `LLM_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `--llm-api-key` | `LLM_API_KEY` | — (required) |
| `--llm-base-url` | `LLM_BASE_URL` | none |

By default the sandbox is deleted when the script exits. Pass `--keep` to leave
it running and print the `DELETE` command instead.

## Another option: react from *inside* the sandbox with hooks

The WebSocket approach is for a client that holds a connection open and reacts
**externally**. If instead you want the sandbox itself to act on a lifecycle
event — notify a URL, run setup, gate an action — you can use **lifecycle
hooks** delivered by a plugin. Hooks run inside the agent-server on events like
`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop`, so there is nothing to
poll and no socket to keep open.

Two examples in this repo show the pattern:

- [`finish-callback`](../finish-callback/) — a **`Stop` hook** that `POST`s to a
  URL you control the moment a conversation finishes. This is the closest
  analogue to "tell me when it's done" without a held-open socket: the sandbox
  pushes to you. (It also documents the callback-plus-polling hybrid for
  reliability.)
- [`gpg-commit-signing`](../gpg-commit-signing/) — a **`SessionStart` hook** that
  configures the environment at the start of *every* conversation, illustrating
  the "run something on a lifecycle event" shape more generally.

Rule of thumb: use the **WebSocket** (this example) when an external client
needs to follow state live; use **hooks** (a plugin) when the reaction should
happen inside the sandbox on a specific lifecycle event. See the
[OpenHands Hooks Guide](https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk/guides/hooks.md) for the
full list of hook types and their blocking semantics.

## Notes

- **Only the sandbox (and, for `watch_attach.py`, the start task) is polled, and
  only for provisioning.** Waiting for `RUNNING` / `READY` is lifecycle, not
  conversation execution state. Once the agent-server is up and the id is known,
  the conversation is entirely event-driven.
- **First-frame auth** keeps the session key out of the URL (and therefore out
  of reverse-proxy / load-balancer access logs). A deprecated
  `?session_api_key=…` query parameter also works but is not recommended.
- **`resend_mode=all`** makes the subscription race-free: because an
  `initial_message` starts the run at create time, some events may already exist
  before the socket connects. Replaying them means the example never misses the
  first `running`. Use `resend_mode=since&after_timestamp=…` if you have already
  fetched history over REST and only want newer events.
- **Terminal states.** The scripts stop at `finished`, `error`, or `stuck`. The
  full set of `ConversationExecutionStatus` values is `idle`, `running`,
  `paused`, `waiting_for_confirmation`, `finished`, `error`, `stuck`,
  `deleting`.
- **Webhooks (reacting from an external service, no held-open socket).** The
  agent-server can also *push* to an HTTP endpoint you host —
  `POST {base_url}/conversations` on start/pause/resume/stop and
  `POST {base_url}/events/{id}` for event batches. That is a good fit when an
  external service, not a long-lived client, needs to react. However, those
  webhooks are supplied via the agent-server's startup config or
  `POST /api/init`, and **OpenHands Cloud sandboxes run with
  `deferred_init=False`** — so there is no way to inject webhook config.
  `GET /api/init` makes this explicit, returning `404` with the message
  `server is not running with deferred_init=True; the /api/init endpoint is not
  available` (a `POST` is rejected at the auth layer first with `401`). So
  agent-server webhooks require an agent-server you run
  yourself (e.g. via Docker). On Cloud, use the WebSocket here, or the in-sandbox
  **`Stop` hook** in [`finish-callback`](../finish-callback/) for a push-style
  finish notification.
