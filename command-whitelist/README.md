# Command Whitelist with Hooks

A self-contained example showing how to use **PreToolUse hooks** in a plugin to **whitelist approved shell commands**. The agent can only execute commands that are explicitly on the approved list - everything else is blocked.

This example demonstrates the **whitelist approach**: deny everything by default, only allow specific approved commands.

## What's in the Box

The [`strict-mode/`](./strict-mode/) plugin bundles:

- **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`) - PreToolUse hook that validates commands against a whitelist
- **Skill** (`skills/strict-mode/SKILL.md`) - Documentation about what's allowed
- **Plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) - Standard Claude Code plugin format

## How It Works

```
User: "Install the requests package with pip"
  ↓
Agent: *prepares terminal command: pip install requests*
  ↓
PreToolUse Hook: *intercepts before execution*
  ├─ Extracts command name: "pip"
  ├─ Checks whitelist: [ls, cat, grep, find, ...]
  ├─ Not found in whitelist!
  └─ Returns exit code 2 (block) + explanation
  ↓
Agent: *receives block + reason, explains to user*
  ↓
User: *sees which commands are allowed*
```

## Whitelisted Commands

Only these commands are allowed (all read-only operations):

**File Operations:** `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `file`
**Search & Filter:** `grep`, `find`, `wc`
**System Info:** `pwd`, `whoami`, `date`, `uname`, `df`, `du`, `stat`
**Utilities:** `echo`, `which`, `env`, `printenv`, `history`, `tree`

Everything else is **blocked by default**.

## Try It

### Option 1: Load via API

Use the companion [`load-plugin`](../load-plugin/) example:

```bash
cd ../load-plugin

# This will be blocked (pip not whitelisted)
python load_plugin.py \
  --repo-path command-whitelist/strict-mode \
  --message "Install the requests package"

# This will be allowed (ls is whitelisted)
python load_plugin.py \
  --repo-path command-whitelist/strict-mode \
  --message "List all Python files in the current directory"
```

### Option 2: Launch via Badge

> **Note:** Replace `ref: main` with your branch name if testing before merge:
> `--ref add-hooks-examples`

## The Hook

The magic happens in [`hooks/hooks.json`](./strict-mode/hooks/hooks.json):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "terminal",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c '... whitelist checking logic ...'",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**How it works:**

1. **`PreToolUse`** - Runs **before** the terminal tool executes
2. **`matcher: "terminal"`** - Only applies to shell commands
3. **Inline bash script:**
   - Extracts the command name from the JSON input
   - Checks if it's in the hardcoded whitelist
   - Returns `exit 0` (allow) or `exit 2` (block)

The whitelist is maintained as a simple newline-separated list in the bash script:

```bash
allowed_commands="
ls
cat
grep
find
# ... etc ...
"
```

## Whitelist vs. Blacklist

| Approach | Strategy | Security | Usability | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Whitelist** (this) | Deny by default, allow specific | ✅ **High** - Can't execute unexpected commands | ⚠️ **Limited** - Must pre-approve everything | High-security, read-only, educational |
| **Blacklist** ([`command-blacklist`](../command-blacklist/)) | Allow by default, block specific | ⚠️ **Medium** - New patterns might slip through | ✅ **Full** - Everything works except blocked | General protection, development work |

**Whitelist** = "Only these few things are allowed"
**Blacklist** = "Everything is allowed except these specific things"

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Whitelist (Strict Mode) When:
- 🎓 **Educational** - Teaching safe command usage
- 🔍 **Analysis only** - Reading/inspecting systems
- 🛡️ **Maximum security** - Untrusted users or agents
- 📊 **Auditing** - Examining existing systems
- 🧪 **Sandboxes** - Limiting experimental environments

### Use Blacklist (Safety Guardian) When:
- 🚀 **Development** - Need full tooling access
- 🔧 **General protection** - Block obvious dangers
- ⚡ **Productivity** - Don't want to pre-approve everything
- 🏗️ **Building** - Need to install, compile, deploy
- 🎯 **Specific risks** - Known dangerous patterns to block

## Extending the Whitelist

To allow additional commands, edit `hooks/hooks.json`:

```bash
allowed_commands="
ls
cat
grep
git        # Add git commands
python     # Add python execution
npm        # Add npm (if you trust it)
"
```

Each command name is matched exactly - no wildcards or partial matches. For commands with subcommands (like `git clone`), you'll need to whitelist the main command (`git`) and handle subcommand validation separately if needed.

## Security Considerations

**✅ Strengths:**
- Completely locks down command execution
- Easy to audit (small whitelist)
- Can't be bypassed by clever command variations
- Works well for truly untrusted agents

**⚠️ Limitations:**
- Very restrictive (might frustrate users)
- Requires updating the list as needs evolve
- Doesn't prevent reading sensitive files (allows `cat /etc/passwd`)
- Simple command extraction (not full shell parsing)

For production security, consider:
1. Combining with file path restrictions
2. Adding argument validation (not just command name)
3. Logging all blocked attempts
4. Using a proper JSON parser instead of grep

## Plugin Structure

```
strict-mode/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata
├── hooks/
│   └── hooks.json           # PreToolUse hook definition
└── skills/
    └── strict-mode/
        └── SKILL.md         # Documentation (auto-loaded)
```

This follows the **Claude Code plugin format**, compatible with:
- OpenHands Cloud plugin launcher
- Claude Desktop plugin marketplace
- Any system supporting the `.claude-plugin` spec

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Code review agents** - Only allow read operations on source code
- **Security auditing** - Inspect systems without modification
- **Student environments** - Safe learning sandbox
- **Public demos** - Allow exploration without damage
- **CI/CD read-only steps** - Verify without changing artifacts

## Progressive Enhancement

Start strict, then gradually expand:

1. **Day 1:** Only allow `ls`, `cat`, `grep` (ultra-strict)
2. **Week 1:** Add `find`, `wc`, `head`, `tail` (more inspection tools)
3. **Month 1:** Add `git` for version control (read-only)
4. **As needed:** Carefully evaluate and add new commands

This way you build trust and understand usage patterns before opening up.
