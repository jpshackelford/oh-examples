# test-mcp-config

Validate **MCP server configurations** against a real sandbox's agent-server,
**before** wiring them into a conversation.

## Why

The OpenHands web UI lets you *add* an MCP server, but it does not currently
tell you whether the server actually connects. If the URL, token, or network
path is wrong, the server's tools simply never appear in a conversation — with
no error shown in the UI. (Under the hood, when multiple MCP servers are
configured, a server that fails to connect is logged as a warning in the
runtime/agent-server logs and silently skipped.)

The agent-server already ships an endpoint that solves this:
`POST /api/mcp/test` connects to a single candidate server, lists its tools,
and optionally invokes one read-only tool to exercise credentials. This example
drives that endpoint from the Cloud API so you can verify a config end-to-end.

> Requires an agent-server that includes `POST /api/mcp/test`
> (added in **agent-server 1.29.0 / OpenHands 1.8.0**). Older runtimes return
> `404` and the script tells you to upgrade the runtime image.

## How it works

```
1. POST /api/v1/sandboxes              -> start a sandbox (no conversation)
2. GET  /api/v1/sandboxes?id=<id>      -> poll until status == RUNNING
3. read exposed_urls[AGENT_SERVER]     -> the sandbox's agent-server URL
   and session_api_key                    + per-sandbox session key
4. POST {agent_server}/api/mcp/test    -> validate each server config
```

`POST /api/mcp/test` returns **HTTP 200 in both success and failure** — a failed
connection is the *expected* outcome of validating user input, not a server
error:

```json
{"ok": true,  "tools": ["..."], "tool_result": null}
{"ok": false, "error": "Client failed to connect: ...", "error_kind": "connection"}
```

`error_kind` is one of `timeout`, `connection`, or `unknown`. Note that HTTP
status failures (e.g. a `401` from a bad token) currently come back as
`unknown` with the status in the `error` text, so read `error` — not just
`error_kind` — when triaging auth problems.

## Auth

```bash
export OH_API_KEY=...    # OpenHands Cloud API key
```

The same key authenticates the app-server calls (via `X-Session-API-Key`); the
agent-server calls use the per-sandbox `session_api_key` returned with the
sandbox.

## Install

Only depends on `requests`:

```bash
pip install requests
# or, from the repo root: uv run --with requests test-mcp-config/test_mcp_config.py ...
```

## Usage

```bash
# Single remote (streamable-http) server with a bearer token
python test_mcp_config.py \
    --url https://mcp.example.com/mcp --type shttp --server-api-key "$TOKEN"

# Use an explicit header instead of --server-api-key, and verify credentials
# by invoking a known read-only tool (listing tools alone often won't):
python test_mcp_config.py --url https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
    --header "Authorization=Bearer $TOKEN" \
    --tool-call list_things

# Stdio (subprocess) server
python test_mcp_config.py --command npx --arg -y --arg some-mcp-server

# Test every server in an SDK-style config file
python test_mcp_config.py --config my_mcp_config.json

# Reuse a sandbox you already started (skips create + delete)
python test_mcp_config.py --sandbox-id <id> --url https://mcp.example.com/mcp
```

`--config` accepts an SDK-style file (the same `mcpServers` shape returned by
`GET /api/v1/settings` under `agent_settings.mcp_config`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira":  {"url": "https://mcp-jira.example.com/http",  "transport": "http"},
    "figma": {"url": "https://mcp-figma.example.com/mcp", "transport": "http"},
    "local": {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "some-mcp-server"]}
  }
}
```

By default the script creates a sandbox, runs the tests, and deletes the
sandbox. Pass `--keep` (or `--sandbox-id`) to leave it running. The process
exits non-zero if any server fails, so it is CI-friendly.

## Example output

Running against three servers (one real public server + two deliberate
failures):

```text
sandbox: pOmqWy0awMfHvIADXCLWy
  status: RUNNING
agent: https://<runtime-host>.prod-runtime.all-hands.dev

--- deepwiki_public  (http: https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp) ---
  OK  connected; 3 tool(s): read_wiki_structure, read_wiki_contents, ask_question

--- bad_dns  (http: http://nonexistent.invalid/mcp) ---
  FAIL  [connection] Client failed to connect: [Errno -2] Name or service not known

--- conn_refused  (http: http://127.0.0.1:1/mcp) ---
  FAIL  [connection] Client failed to connect: All connection attempts failed

1/3 server(s) OK.

Deleting sandbox pOmqWy0awMfHvIADXCLWy ...
```

## Notes & limitations

- **Credentials checked only on tool invocation.** Some servers connect and
  list tools fine with a bad token, and only fail when a tool runs. Pass
  `--tool-call <read-only-tool>` to exercise those credentials; the outcome is
  reported under `tool_result` and does **not** change `ok`.
- **Plaintext secrets.** This example sends whatever token/headers you pass, in
  plaintext, to the sandbox you control. (The web UI's "edit" flow round-trips
  *encrypted* stored secrets to the same endpoint; that cross-cipher path is a
  UI-internal detail and out of scope here.)
- **Self-hosted / Enterprise.** Point `--base-url` (or `OH_API_BASE`) at your
  deployment. The flow is identical as long as the runtime image is new enough
  to expose `POST /api/mcp/test`.
