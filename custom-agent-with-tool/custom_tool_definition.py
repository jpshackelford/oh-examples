"""Custom tool definition - Bureau of Bug Registration.

A deliberately absurd custom tool built with the OpenHands SDK. `working_example.py`
deploys this file into a Cloud sandbox as an importable module so the agent-server
can load it via `tool_module_qualnames`. Importing this module registers the tool
(see the `register_tool` call at the bottom).

Why this tool? It does something an LLM would never produce on its own and could not
fake: it assigns each bug a deterministic, hash-derived Case ID (e.g. BUG-7F3A2C)
plus a gloriously bureaucratic classification. Because the Case ID is a SHA-256 slice
of the bug report, the only way the agent's answer can contain the correct ID is if it
actually called this tool - which makes the end-to-end demonstration unfalsifiable.
