# Detect a conversation's terminal state over the WebSocket (deep dive)

A follow-on to [`react-to-state-websocket`](../react-to-state-websocket/). That
example covers the basics — start a Cloud sandbox, **attach** a conversation (no
LLM key needed), open the agent-server WebSocket
(`/sockets/events/{conversation_id}`), and print every `execution_status`
transition. **Read it first.**

This example keeps the *same Cloud approach* and layers on what you need to know
to answer one specific question reliably: **"is this conversation actually
done?"** — and then exit. It adds three things on top of the basics:

1. **Both event shapes.** `ConversationStateUpdateEvent` arrives two ways; a
   robust "am I done?" check reads both.
2. **`finished` is advisory; `error`/`stuck` are immediate.** A per-field
   `finished` can be reverted by a Stop hook, so it is confirmed with a
   `full_state` snapshot.
3. **First-message auth**, keeping the session key out of URLs and proxy logs.

One file:

- [`watch_terminal_state.py`](./watch_terminal_state.py) — start a sandbox,
  attach a conversation, watch the socket, and report the **confirmed** terminal
  state.

## Prerequisite

Start with [`react-to-state-websocket`](../react-to-state-websocket/) for the
Cloud sandbox lifecycle (create → attach → start-task poll → delete) and the
socket subscription. Everything here builds directly on that; the sandbox and
attach code is intentionally identical so you can focus on the new parts.

## What this adds

### 1. Both `ConversationStateUpdateEvent` shapes

The agent-server reports state over the socket in **two** shapes, and they carry
the same `execution_status` field in different places:

| Shape | Frame | Where `execution_status` lives |
|-------|-------|--------------------------------|
| **per-field** | `{"kind":"ConversationStateUpdateEvent","key":"execution_status","value":"finished"}` | `value` (a string) |
| **full-state** | `{"kind":"ConversationStateUpdateEvent","key":"full_state","value":{…,"execution_status":"finished"}}` | `value["execution_status"]` |

`react-to-state-websocket` reads only the per-field shape — perfect for printing
transitions as they happen. For a reliable *terminal* check you want both,
because the authoritative confirmation comes in the full-state snapshot (next
point). `watch_terminal_state.py` handles both in `_status_from_event()`.

### 2. `finished` is advisory; `error` / `stuck` are immediate

The SDK treats a per-field `finished` as **provisional**: a `Stop` hook can
intercept the stop and resume the run (that is exactly what
[`finish-callback`](../finish-callback/) does). The **authoritative** signal is
the `full_state` snapshot emitted once the run settles. So this example:

- remembers a per-field `finished` but does **not** exit on it,
- exits when a `full_state` snapshot reports `finished`,
- exits **immediately** on `error` or `stuck` in either shape (those are not
  revertible).

You can see both steps in the real run below: a provisional per-field `finished`,
then the confirming `full_state`.

### 3. First-message auth (log-safe)

The socket accepts the session key three ways: an `X-Session-API-Key` header, a
`?session_api_key=…` query parameter (**deprecated**), or a first WebSocket
frame `{"type":"auth","session_api_key":"…"}`. This example uses the **first
frame**, so the key never appears in the URL — and therefore never lands in
reverse-proxy or load-balancer access logs. (`resend_mode=all` stays in the
query string; it is not a secret.)

## APIs used

Same as [`react-to-state-websocket`](../react-to-state-websocket/):

- **Cloud app server** (`https://app.all-hands.dev`, `X-Session-API-Key: <OH_API_KEY>`):
  - `POST /api/v1/sandboxes` — start a sandbox
  - `GET  /api/v1/sandboxes?id=<id>` — poll until `RUNNING`
  - `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` — attach a conversation (returns a start task)
  - `GET  /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks?ids=<id>` — poll for the id
  - `DELETE /api/v1/sandboxes/{id}?sandbox_id=<id>` — clean up
- **Agent server** (the sandbox's `AGENT_SERVER` exposed URL, `session_api_key`):
  - `GET /sockets/events/{conversation_id}` — the **WebSocket** event stream
    (`wss://…`), first-frame auth, `?resend_mode=all` to replay events emitted
    before the socket connected.

## Run it

```bash
export OH_API_KEY=...        # your https://app.all-hands.dev API key
pip install requests websockets

python watch_terminal_state.py
```

No LLM key is required: attaching through the Cloud app server injects your
account's configured LLM.

### Flags

| Flag | Env var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--api-key` | `OH_API_KEY` | — (required) |
| `--base-url` | `OH_API_BASE` | `https://app.all-hands.dev` |
| `--sandbox-spec-id` | `SANDBOX_SPEC_ID` | none (account default image) |
| `--message` | — | `Say hello in one short sentence, then stop.` |
| `--poll-timeout` | `POLL_TIMEOUT` | `180` (sandbox / start-task) |
| `--watch-timeout` | — | `180` (socket watch) |
| `--keep` | — | off (deletes the sandbox at the end) |

## What it prints

```
sandbox: 5GcGcTMU1BSlCWzQBl7hhk
  sandbox status: STARTING
  sandbox status: RUNNING

```

## Notes

- **No conversation-state polling.** Only the sandbox lifecycle and the
  start-task are polled, and only for provisioning. Every `execution_status`
  signal comes off the socket.
- **The terminal set** is `finished`, `error`, `stuck`
  (`ConversationExecutionStatus.is_terminal()`). `idle` is excluded — it is also
  the *initial* state before a run starts.
- **Simpler variant.** If you do not care about the advisory/confirmed
  distinction, reading only the per-field shape (as
  `react-to-state-websocket` does) and stopping on the first `finished` is
  shorter — just slightly less precise if a Stop hook is in play.

## Running locally without Cloud

The audience for this example is **Cloud**. If you have no Cloud account, the
identical socket also runs against an agent-server you start yourself in Docker —
point `ws://localhost:<port>/sockets/events/{id}` at it and pass the
`SESSION_API_KEY` you launched the container with. See
[`start-sandbox`](../start-sandbox/) for the agent-server image and
[`server-info-idle`](../server-info-idle/) for a local Docker fallback pattern.
The event handling in `watch_terminal_state.py` is unchanged; only how you obtain
the agent-server URL + session key differs.
