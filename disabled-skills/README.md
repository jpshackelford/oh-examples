# Disabling Skills for Every Conversation on an Account

Keep specific OpenHands skills out of every conversation an account starts,
using the Cloud **Settings API** — the same endpoint the UI's *Settings →
Skills* page toggles. Once installed, the deny-list applies to every
`POST /api/v1/app-conversations` call that account makes, without the
caller having to pass anything on each request.

`POST /api/v1/settings` with `{"disabled_skills": [...]}` persists an
**account-level** deny-list. On every conversation start the App Server
computes `effective_disabled_skills = member ∪ profile ∪ request` and drops
matching skill names from the `<SKILLS>` block that ships in the first
`SystemPromptEvent`. A skill disabled at any level stays off.

Feature shipped in OpenHands Enterprise **1.62.0**
([enterprise#335](https://github.com/OpenHands/enterprise/pull/335)) and is
also live on OpenHands Cloud.

## When to use this

Prefer the **account-level** setting for anything policy-shaped:

- The team should never see a certain skill (e.g. no external git
  integrations on an internal build; no `docker` when your sandbox base
  image can't run nested Docker).
- The deny-list must be enforced consistently — you can't accidentally
  start a conversation without it because you forgot the field.
- You don't want callers of the API to have to remember to include
  `disabled_skills` on every request.

Reach for the **per-request** field (`disabled_skills` on
`POST /api/v1/app-conversations`) only as an escape hatch:

- One-off runs that need extra skills off, on top of the account default.
- Ad-hoc experiments where you're trying deny-lists without touching the
  persisted setting.

## Precedence

`effective_disabled_skills` (from
`openhands/app_server/app_conversation/live_status_app_conversation_service.py`)
takes the union of three sources, order-preserving, de-duplicated:

| Level | Where it lives | How to set it |
|---|---|---|
| Account (member) | `user.disabled_skills` | `POST /api/v1/settings` with `disabled_skills: [...]` — this tutorial |
| Launched Agent Profile | `agent_context.disabled_skills` on the resolved profile | `POST /api/v1/settings/profiles/{name}` |
| Per-request | `disabled_skills` on the start request | `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` with `disabled_skills: [...]` |

A name absent from the discovered skill catalog is a **harmless no-op** —
you can safely include speculative names without failing the request. Names
are matched exactly (case-sensitive) against the `<name>` values returned by
`GET /api/v1/skills/search?q=<prefix>` (a bare call with no `q` returns
microagents mixed in; pass a prefix like `?q=github` to see the skill names
that appear in the `<SKILLS>` block).

## ⚠ Caveat: deny-first means new OpenHands skills opt you in

The current design is a **deny-list**, not an allow-list: anything that isn't
explicitly disabled is loaded. That is deliberately drift-tolerant for most
callers — a name you listed that no longer exists is a no-op, so your config
survives rename/removal — but it has one consequence worth understanding
before you ship this to production:

> **When the OpenHands team adds a new built-in skill in a future SDK
> release, every account whose `disabled_skills` doesn't name it will start
> loading it on the next conversation, with no code change on your side.**

For most teams that's the desired behaviour: you get new capabilities for
free. But it's a problem when:

- **Code (yours or an agent's) references skills by name.** A new skill
  whose name collides with a trigger keyword or auto-injection rule you
  depend on can start firing on turns it didn't fire on yesterday, changing
  observable behaviour without a deploy on your side.
- **The deny-list is policy, not preference.** If `disabled_skills` is
  there because an auditor said "no external git integrations", the correct
  guarantee is "no git integrations ever", not "no git integrations we knew
  about at the time". A new `gerrit` or `codecommit` skill would quietly
  bypass that intent.
- **You need a stable per-turn context budget.** New skills (even if never
  invoked) still show up in the `<SKILLS>` block of the dynamic context and
  consume tokens.

### Lock-down pattern: snapshot the catalog, then deny everything else

When you need tight control, treat the current skill catalog as the
authoritative set and deny everything in it except the names you want to
keep. This inverts the deny-list into an effective allow-list while still
using the only mechanism the server exposes.

The authoritative source for "what skills does the agent see by default"
is the `<SKILLS>` block of a `SystemPromptEvent` on a probe conversation
started with **no** `disabled_skills` set. (`GET /api/v1/skills/search`
without a `q` prefix returns microagents rather than the SDK skills that
appear in `<SKILLS>`, so parsing the event is the reliable path — the
same path `disabled_skills.py` uses to verify absence.)

```python
import re
import requests

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
_SKILLS_BLOCK = re.compile(r"<SKILLS>(.*?)</SKILLS>", re.DOTALL)
_SKILL_NAME = re.compile(r"<name>([^<]+)</name>")

# 1. Clear any existing deny-list so the probe sees the full catalog.
requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/settings", headers=headers, json={"disabled_skills": []},
)

# 2. Start a probe conversation and poll start-tasks until READY (omitted
#    for brevity — see custom-system-prompt/custom_system_prompt.py).
probe_conv_id = start_and_wait(base_url, headers)

# 3. Read SystemPromptEvent and extract every <name> in <SKILLS>.
event = requests.get(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/conversation/{probe_conv_id}/events/search",
    headers=headers,
    params={"kind__eq": "SystemPromptEvent", "limit": 1},
).json()["items"][0]

skills_block = _SKILLS_BLOCK.search(event["dynamic_context"]["text"]).group(1)
all_skill_names = set(_SKILL_NAME.findall(skills_block))

# 4. Decide the small set you *do* want.
allowed = {"github", "linear", "uv"}

# 5. Deny the complement.
requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/settings",
    headers=headers,
    json={"disabled_skills": sorted(all_skill_names - allowed)},
)
```

The probe is a one-time cost per catalog refresh; cache
`all_skill_names` and reuse it until the next SDK upgrade.

Operational notes for teams running this as policy:

- **Re-snapshot on every SDK or platform upgrade.** A new build may ship
  new skill names; your deny-list won't cover them until you refresh it.
  Wire the snapshot step into your deploy pipeline (or run it on a
  schedule) rather than treating the deny-list as set-and-forget.
- **Diff before you apply.** `set(current) ^ set(snapshot)` tells you
  exactly which skill names appeared or disappeared since the last run —
  surface that in a code review or audit log so a human owns the decision
  about any newcomer.
- **The agent profile is the right place to persist a locked-down set.**
  `POST /api/v1/settings/profiles/{name}` holds a `disabled_skills` list
  that applies on top of the account-level one, so a `"locked-down"`
  profile can carry the full complement without the account default
  having to repeat it.

An explicit allow-list field isn't currently exposed by the API; snapshot +
deny-the-rest is the supported workaround.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install requests
export OH_API_KEY="your-api-key"   # Cloud: Profile → API Keys.
                                   # OHE: Settings → API Keys on your instance.
```

The account whose API key you use is the one whose `disabled_skills`
setting the script mutates and then restores.

## Run

```bash
# default: 'no-git-integrations' gallery, account-level only
python disabled_skills.py

# pick a different gallery
python disabled_skills.py --gallery no-docker
python disabled_skills.py --gallery no-github-automations

# explicit skill names (overrides --gallery)
python disabled_skills.py --disable docker kubernetes pdflatex

# also start a second conversation with additional per-request skills
# to demonstrate account ∪ request:
python disabled_skills.py --per-request

# target an OpenHands Enterprise instance:
python disabled_skills.py --base-url https://your-ohe.example.com

# keep conversations for inspection (account setting is still restored):
python disabled_skills.py --keep
```

The script:

1. Reads and remembers the current account-level `disabled_skills`.
2. Installs the requested deny-list via `POST /api/v1/settings`.
3. Starts a conversation with **no** `disabled_skills` on the request,
   proving the account-level setting alone keeps the skills out.
4. Parses `<SKILLS>` in `dynamic_context.text` and asserts every disabled
   name is absent.
5. Optionally repeats with per-request `disabled_skills` to show union.
6. Deletes the conversation(s) and sandbox(es), and restores the original
   account-level setting — the beta instance is left as it was found.

Exit status is non-zero if any verification fails.

Conversation 1 loaded 103 skills; conversation 2 loaded 102 (the extra
`flarglebargle` denial removed one). Every denied name is absent from
the `<SKILLS>` block of the `SystemPromptEvent`.

## How it works

### 1. Install the account-level deny-list

```python
requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/settings",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
    json={"disabled_skills": ["github", "gitlab", "bitbucket"]},
)
```

This is a partial settings save — the server deep-merges, so sending just
this one field leaves every other setting untouched. It's the exact call
the UI's *Settings → Skills* page makes via
`useSkillMutations.saveDisabledSkills` in
[`frontend/src/hooks/mutation/use-skill-mutations.ts`](https://github.com/OpenHands/enterprise/blob/main/frontend/src/hooks/mutation/use-skill-mutations.ts).

One footgun: the server treats a `null` payload as "no change" (it copies
the previously-persisted list forward). To clear the deny-list, send `[]`.
`effective_disabled_skills` treats `None` and `[]` identically, so the
observable behaviour is the same.

### 2. Start a conversation with nothing on the request

```python
requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/app-conversations",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "initial_message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Say hello."}],
        },
        "title": "no per-request disabled_skills",
    },
)
```

No `disabled_skills` field is sent — the account-level setting is doing
all the work.

### 3. Verify from the `SystemPromptEvent`

The `SystemPromptEvent` is the first event in every conversation. Its
`dynamic_context.text` contains a `<SKILLS>...</SKILLS>` block listing
every skill the agent can invoke:

```xml
<SKILLS>
The following skills are available. ...
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>github-resilience</name>
    <description>...</description>
  </skill>
  ...
</available_skills>
</SKILLS>
```

The script parses out every `<name>` and asserts none of the denied names
are present:

```python
event = requests.get(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/conversation/{conv_id}/events/search",
    headers=headers,
    params={"kind__eq": "SystemPromptEvent", "limit": 1},
).json()["items"][0]

skills_block = re.search(
    r"<SKILLS>(.*?)</SKILLS>",
    event["dynamic_context"]["text"],
    re.DOTALL,
).group(1)
loaded = re.findall(r"<name>([^<]+)</name>", skills_block)

assert set(disabled_names).isdisjoint(loaded)
```

See the [`custom-system-prompt`](../custom-system-prompt/) tutorial for
the full shape of `SystemPromptEvent`.

### 4. Cleanup and restore

```python
requests.delete(f"{base_url}/api/v1/app-conversations/{conv_id}", headers=headers)
requests.delete(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}",
    headers=headers,
    params={"sandbox_id": sandbox_id},
)
requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/settings",
    headers=headers,
    json={"disabled_skills": original or []},
)
```

The script always restores the original account setting, even on error
(via `try / finally`), so a failed run never leaves the account with a
stuck deny-list.

## Deny-list gallery

Common recipes, all exposed through `--gallery`:

### `no-git-integrations`

Drop every git-hosting integration skill. Useful for internal-only
environments or when you're deliberately keeping the agent off customer
repos.

```python
[
    "github",
    "gitlab",
    "bitbucket",
    "bitbucket-cloud",
    "bitbucket-data-center",
    "azure-devops",
]
```

### `no-browser`

Turn off skills whose primary value is browsing/preview flows. (The
browser *tool* itself is off via the agent config, not this deny-list;
see [`../custom-agent-no-browser/`](../custom-agent-no-browser/).)

```python
["frontend-design", "vercel"]
```

### `no-docker`

Keep the agent out of Docker and Kubernetes skills — appropriate when
your sandbox base image doesn't support nested Docker.

```python
["docker", "kubernetes"]
```

### `no-github-automations`

Keep the general `github` skill available but hide the automation
recipes (workflows, monitors, watchdogs) if they're not for this team.

```python
[
    "github-actions",
    "github-agents-md-maintainer",
    "github-delivery-watchdog",
    "github-issue-to-pr",
    "github-issue-triage",
    "github-pr-review",
    "github-pr-reviewer",
    "github-repo-monitor",
    "github-stale-ci-pr-closer",
]
```

Roll your own with `--disable name1 name2 name3`. Skill names come from
`GET /api/v1/skills/search?q=<prefix>`.

## Per-request escape hatch

Set `disabled_skills` on the start request to *extend* the deny-list for
a single conversation:

```python
requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/api/v1/app-conversations",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "disabled_skills": ["flarglebargle"],
        "initial_message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Say hello."}],
        },
        "title": "one-off deny-list bump",
    },
)
```

The three levels union — you can't *re-enable* an account- or
profile-level denial by omitting it here. If the account has `[github]`
and the request sends `[docker]`, the effective deny-list is
`[github, docker]`.

## Endpoints used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/settings` | GET | Read current account `disabled_skills` (for restore) |
| `/api/v1/settings` | POST | Install / clear the account-level deny-list |
| `/api/v1/app-conversations` | POST | Start the conversation (`disabled_skills` optional) |
| `/api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks` | GET | Poll the start task for `app_conversation_id` |
| `/api/v1/conversation/{id}/events/search` | GET | Read `SystemPromptEvent` to verify |
| `/api/v1/app-conversations/{id}` | DELETE | Delete the conversation |
| `/api/v1/sandboxes/{id}?sandbox_id={id}` | DELETE | Delete the sandbox |
| `/api/v1/skills/search?q=<prefix>` | GET | Discover valid skill names for the deny-list |

All calls use `Authorization: Bearer <OH_API_KEY>`.

## Feature availability

- OpenHands Cloud (currently deployed)
- OpenHands Enterprise **1.62.0+**
  ([enterprise#335](https://github.com/OpenHands/enterprise/pull/335))

To verify on a specific deployment, look for `disabled_skills` in both the
`GETSettingsModel` and the `AppConversationStartRequest-Input` schemas:

```bash
curl -s https://your-deployment/openapi.json | jq '
  .components.schemas.GETSettingsModel.properties.disabled_skills,
  .components.schemas["AppConversationStartRequest-Input"].properties.disabled_skills
'
```

To confirm the endpoint you're calling is the same one the UI uses,
grep the enterprise frontend:

```bash
gh repo clone OpenHands/enterprise
grep -rn "disabled_skills" enterprise/frontend/src/hooks/mutation/
# -> use-skill-mutations.ts calls SettingsService.saveSettings({ disabled_skills })
# -> settings-service.api.ts posts to /api/v1/settings
```
