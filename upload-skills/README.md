# Upload a local skills directory, then start a conversation

This example is a small command-line tool: you hand it a **local agent-skills
directory** and it provisions a sandbox, copies your skills into the right place
inside it, and starts a fresh conversation that can use them. It prints the URL
of the conversation it just created.

It builds on [`clone-and-attach`](../clone-and-attach/), which prepares a sandbox
(clone + `setup.sh`) and then attaches a conversation. Here we prepare the
sandbox by **uploading skills** instead. Read [`start-sandbox`](../start-sandbox/)
first if the sandbox/agent-server split is new to you.

## Why would I do this?

You have skills authored locally (a folder of `SKILL.md` files) and you want an
agent to use them *without* committing them to a repo or installing them by
hand. This script drops them into the sandbox's **user skills directory** before
the conversation starts, so the brand-new conversation loads them automatically.

> **Most of the time you don't need this script.** The standard ways to give a
> workspace skills are to **store them in your repository as a plugin** (e.g.
> under `.openhands/skills/`) and **start the conversation with that plugin
> reference**, or to run **`/add-skill <github-url>`** to add a skill to the
> workspace. Reach for this example when you want to push *local, uncommitted*
> skills straight into a sandbox programmatically — for automation, quick
> experiments, or skills you're not ready to commit.

### Where do the skills go, and why there?

When OpenHands starts a conversation it loads skills from several sources and
merges them. **User skills** come from the sandbox user's home:

- `~/.openhands/skills/`   ← this example's default target
- `~/.agents/skills/`      ← newer AgentSkills location (use `--remote-skills-dir`)
- `~/.openhands/microagents/` (legacy)

Because the upload happens **before** the conversation is created, the loader
picks the skills up for that conversation. (The start-task lifecycle even has a
dedicated `SETTING_UP_SKILLS` phase.) Putting them under the user home — rather
than a repo's `.openhands/skills/` — means they load regardless of whether a
repository is selected.

> Already-running conversations are **not** re-scanned. Upload skills first,
> then start the conversation — which is exactly what this script does.

## The flow

```
POST /api/v1/sandboxes                       # 1. start a sandbox (no conversation)
GET  /api/v1/sandboxes?id=<id>               # 2. poll until status == RUNNING
GET  {agent}/api/file/home                   # 3. resolve ~  (sandbox user's home)
POST {agent}/api/file/upload?path=<tmp>      # 4a. upload one tar.gz of your skills
POST {agent}/api/bash/execute_bash_command   # 4b. extract it into ~/.openhands/skills
POST /api/v1/app-conversations               # 5. start a conversation (sandbox_id=<id>)
GET  /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks   # 5b. poll for the app_conversation_id
```

Steps 1–2 and 5 use the **Cloud app server** (auth header
`X-Session-API-Key: <OH_API_KEY>`). Steps 3–4 use the sandbox's **agent server**
(auth header `X-Session-API-Key: <session_api_key>`, returned by the create
call). The agent server is where file upload and shell execution live — the
Cloud app server has no file-upload route.

### Recursive copy without per-file round-trips

Rather than upload files one at a time, the script tars the **contents** of your
local directory (`arcname="."`) into a single `.tar.gz`, uploads that one
archive, and extracts it with `tar -xzf ... -C <target>`. So a local layout
like:

```
my-skills/
├── code-review/SKILL.md
└── deploy-helper/SKILL.md
```

ends up as `~/.openhands/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` and
`~/.openhands/skills/deploy-helper/SKILL.md` in the sandbox.

## Run it

```bash
export OH_API_KEY=...        # your https://app.all-hands.dev API key
pip install requests

# Zero-config: uploads the bundled example-skills/ and starts a conversation
# that asks the agent to list the skills it can see.
python upload_skills.py ./example-skills
```

Sample output:

```
local skills dir: /path/to/oh-examples/upload-skills/example-skills
  AgentSkills (SKILL.md): 1
    - hello-openhands
  loose .md skills:       0
sandbox: 1ho9eZpt4m27CC23XPdGcN
  sandbox status: RUNNING
agent: https://ahhygodzefollslv.prod-runtime.all-hands.dev

=== upload skills -> /home/openhands/.openhands/skills ===
  uploading 412 bytes -> /tmp/oh-upload-skills.tar.gz
$ extract skills  (exit=0)
installed skills:
  hello-openhands/SKILL.md

=== start conversation ===
  start-task status: SETTING_UP_SKILLS
  start-task status: STARTING_CONVERSATION
  start-task status: READY

Conversation started on your skills-loaded sandbox:
  https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/f041a2e252cf45b39a46a3189b2efce7
```

Open that URL and ask the agent to *"say hello"* — it should answer using the
uploaded `hello-openhands` skill.

## Point it at your own skills

Every input is a flag with an environment-variable fallback, so the script is
safe to drop into your own automation unchanged:

| Flag | Env var | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| `skills_dir` (positional) | — | — (required) | Local skills directory to upload |
| `--api-key` | `OH_API_KEY` | — (required) | Cloud API key |
| `--base-url` | `OH_API_BASE` | `https://app.all-hands.dev` | Cloud app server |
| `--remote-skills-dir` | `REMOTE_SKILLS_DIR` | `~/.openhands/skills` | Destination in the sandbox (`~` expands to the sandbox home) |
| `--message` | `INITIAL_MESSAGE` | a "list your skills" prompt | First message to the agent |
| `--title` | `CONVERSATION_TITLE` | `upload-skills demo` | Conversation title |
| `--sandbox-id` | `SANDBOX_ID` | none | Reuse a RUNNING sandbox instead of creating one |
| `--sandbox-spec-id` | `SANDBOX_SPEC_ID` | account default | Runtime image to start |
| `--poll-timeout` | `POLL_TIMEOUT` | `240` | Seconds to wait for readiness |

```bash
# Upload your own folder of SKILL.md skills and target the newer location.
python upload_skills.py ~/my-skills \
    --remote-skills-dir '~/.agents/skills' \
    --message "Use my deploy-helper skill to outline a release plan."
```

### Reusing the sandbox so new conversations load these skills automatically

Once this script runs, the uploaded skills live in the sandbox's home directory,
so the sandbox is now a ready-made, skills-loaded environment. Whether *new*
conversations reuse it — and therefore inherit those skills for free — is
controlled by the **Sandbox Grouping Strategy** setting under
**Settings → Application**.

- **Default — `No Grouping (new sandbox per conversation)`:** every new
  conversation gets its own fresh sandbox, so conversations you start later
  (in the UI or via the API) will **not** see the skills uploaded here.
- **Any grouping strategy** (e.g. `Group by Newest`, `Add to Any`,
  `Least Recently Used`, `Fewest Conversations`): new conversations are added to
  an existing, still-running sandbox instead of a fresh one. Because every
  conversation reloads skills from the sandbox home when it starts, the
  conversations you create **straight from the web UI** land on this
  skills-loaded sandbox and pick up the uploaded skills automatically — no
  re-running this script needed.

So a typical flow is: run this script once to seed a sandbox with your skills,
set a grouping strategy in the UI, then just open new conversations normally and
they'll already know your skills.

> **Caveat: this only works while the seeded sandbox is still running.** A new
> conversation can only join a sandbox that is still running. If the seeded
> sandbox has gone **inactive** (paused after a stretch of no activity, but not
> yet deleted), a new conversation starts a *fresh* sandbox instead — without
> your skills. Reopening an **existing** conversation still brings its sandbox
> back (and your skills with it), and you can always reuse a specific sandbox —
> even an inactive one — by passing `--sandbox-id <sandbox_id>`, which wakes it
> up.

(If you'd rather stay scripted, you can also target a specific sandbox directly
with `--sandbox-id <sandbox_id>` / `SANDBOX_ID` instead of relying on the
grouping setting — this resumes the sandbox if it is paused.)

### Skill format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What it does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent...
```

Add an optional `triggers:` list to auto-activate a skill when keywords appear
in a user message. See the bundled [`example-skills/`](./example-skills/) for a
working sample.

## Cleanup

The sandbox is intentionally left running because a live conversation is now
attached to it — deleting the sandbox ends that conversation. Delete it from the
conversation UI, or via the API (the id goes in **both** the path and a required
`sandbox_id` query parameter):

```bash
SID=<sandbox_id>
curl -X DELETE "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/v1/sandboxes/${SID}?sandbox_id=${SID}" \
     -H "X-Session-API-Key: $OH_API_KEY"
```
